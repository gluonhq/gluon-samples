CloudLink-Function-Mapper-Desktop
===========

Learn how you can retrieve external data in your JavaFX desktop application by configuring Remote Functions in Gluon CloudLink. 
The Java code calls a function with parameters, and this function makes a request to Gluon CloudLink. 
The Function Mapper in Gluon CloudLink will then call the corresponding external endpoint, providing the required parameters.

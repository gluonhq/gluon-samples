            Since the model is oriented with White to the right and blue in the bottom,
            two rotations are required:
            - first rotate -90ยบX B->F (Rx[-Pi/2])
            - then + 90ยบ Z W->U (Rz[Pi/2])
            Mathematically, 2nd rotation matrix multiplies on the left the 1st matrix: Rz[Pi/2].Rx[-Pi/2]
            Check this link to notice the difference of add/append or prepend a transformation:
            http://hg.openjdk.java.net/openjfx/8/master/rt/file/f89b7dc932af/modules/graphics/src/main/java/javafx/scene/transform/Affine.java        
            
            Notice this will be wrong:
            * cubiePart.getTransforms().addAll(new Rotate(-90, Rotate.X_AXIS),new Rotate(90, Rotate.Z_AXIS)); 
            as it will perform this: Rx[-Pi/2].Rz[Pi/2] ->Red on top, yellow front!
            
            Also this is wrong:
            * cubiePart.getTransforms().addAll(new Rotate(90, Rotate.Z_AXIS),new Rotate(-90, Rotate.X_AXIS)); 
            It does the right rotations, but then it will require for further rotations of any cubie to be rotated from 
            its original position, which is quite more complicated than rotating always from the last state.
            
            PREPEND is the right way to proceed here, so we just need to prepend the last R matrix to the Affine matrix
            of the cubie with all the previous rotations stored there.
